\part{The Plan}

\section{Working Title}
\begin{quote}
the working title of the investigation
\end{quote}
The Physics of Solar Panels

\section{Aim}
\begin{quote}
the aim of the investigation
\end{quote}
This investigation will
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Investigate the proportionality of light intensity and voltage
  \item Investigate the proportionality of light intensity and current
  \item Deduce the resistance of the solar panel
  \item Investigate the effect of light colour and voltage
\end{enumerate}

\section{Initial Experiments}
\begin{quote}
an outline of the initial experiments
\end{quote}
For ease of recording, we want the apparatus to return values that can be accurately and quickly recorded. This means we want the equiptment to return values between 0 and 999, and no more than two decimal places
\begin{itemize}
  \item Find an appropriate initial intensity
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First, the LCD panel was connected to power and turned on
    \item Then, the panel was set to maximim brightness, and the light meter attached
    \item The light meter was then set to 2000, as that gave integer values between 0 and 999
  \end{itemize}
  \item Find appropriate voltmeter sensitivity settings
  \begin{itemize}
    \item With the panel still turned on, the solar cell was affixed to the LCD panel, using blue tack to minimise light leak
    \item Then, the panel was set to maximum brightness, and the solar cell was connected to the Multimeter
    \item The multimeter was adjusted to 200m for voltage, as this sensitivity returned values between 0 and 999, and no more than two decimal places
  \end{itemize}
  \item Find appropriate ammeter sensitivity settings
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The multimeter was then set to 20$\mu$ for current, as this sensitivity returned values between 0 and 999, and no more than two decimal places
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
